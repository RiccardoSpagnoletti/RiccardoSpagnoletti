# Riccardo Spagnoletti

Hello! My name is Riccardo Spagnoletti, and I am a Computer Engineering student at the University of Pisa. In this repository, I publish the projects I have created, making them available to anyone interested in exploring or contributing.

## ðŸ“Œ Repository Purpose

This repository is designed to gather and share my projects, giving anyone the opportunity to review the code and, where possible, actively participate in its development. Each project is described in detail in its respective README file, with instructions on how to install and use the various components.
